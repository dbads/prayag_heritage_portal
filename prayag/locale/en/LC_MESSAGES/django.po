"The city was earlier known as Prayāga, a name still commonly used. Prayāga "
"existed during the Vedic period, and is mentioned in the Veda as the "
"location where Brahma (the Hindu creator of the universe) attended a ritual "
"sacrifice. Excavations have revealed Northern Black Polished Ware dating to "
"600–700 BCE.[15] The Puranas record that Yayati left Prayaga and conquered "
"the region of Saptha Sindhu.[16] His five sons (Yadu, Druhyu, Puru, Anu and "
"Turvashu) founded the main tribes of the Rigveda.[17] Lord Rama, the "
"protagonist of the Ramayana, spent time at the Ashram of Sage Bharadwaj "

"before India was colonised. Allahabad became a part of the Delhi Sultanate "
"when it was annexed by Mohammad Ghori in 1193. Later, the Mughals took over "
"from the slave rulers of Delhi and under them Allahabad rose to prominence. "
"Allahabad was a provincial capital in the Moghul Empire under the reign of "
"Jahangir. Padshah (emperor) Akbar the Great made it the seat of Illahabad "
"Subah, one of his twelve original subahs (imperial top-level provinces), "
"built a fort on the banks of the sangam and renamed the settlement Ilāhābād "
